# AwesomeGitHub

Here you can find materials used for the presentation, including the Keynote. I made an effort to commit some changes, so there's a history of the progress on this presentation about GitHub, some of it's features and the so-called [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) you can find on here. <br/>
